Install Instructions (includes optional features)
______________________________________________

- Install both the skin and container as a HOST extension

- Ensure the WET build folder is in the root of your website

- Update the Host settings admin bar to use the PWGSC bar

- Update the Host/Admin skins to use HOST: CLF - Layout skin

- Ensure you have the following in your web.config in System.Webservers 
(may not be needed for all sites).  There are alternatives to this if you don't have IIS 7 and for ensuring videos play properly.

<staticContent>
    <clientCache cacheControlMode="UseMaxAge" cacheControlMaxAge="7.00:00:00" />
    <mimeMap fileExtension=".mp4" mimeType="video/mp4" />
    <mimeMap fileExtension=".webm" mimeType="video/webm" />
</staticContent>
<httpProtocol>
  <customHeaders>
    <clear />
    <add name="X-UA-Compatible" value="IE=Edge" />
  </customHeaders>
</httpProtocol>


- Depending on your version of Jquery, you may need to make sure you're using the latest version of Jquery and Jquery UI in the host settings.  Use this hosted version to check.  You can also link these to the WET jquery file, or use the default DNN jquery file (just ensure the WET and DNN both work with the jquery file used)

http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js
http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1/jquery-ui.min.js

- <div id="wb-body"> </div> needs to be added AROUND the dnn:Form tag in default.aspx.  Hopefully this is not needed in the future as well.

- Start with a clean portal.css file for each portal

- Use the included default.css file in portals/_default (removes font sizes and things like that), this prevents DNN from overriding the WET CSS.

- Add these lines to your Host Friendly URL settings for proper URL formatting

.*fr-CA(.*)  TO   $1?lang=fra
.*en-CA(.*)  TO   $1?lang=eng
.*en-US(.*)  TO   $1?lang=eng

- The default tabs need to be set in the Admin settings for Search and Home id, this has to be done in each language used.

- For Chrome you need to add the favicon.ico to the portal site settings

- To use the custom Error page, add this to the web config in place of your current customerrors

<customErrors mode="On" defaultRedirect="~/errorpage.aspx" >
    <error statusCode="404" redirect="~/portals/_default/skins/clf3/errorpages/404.aspx"/>
</customErrors>

Setting Site Metadata
______________________________________________

- Multilingual meta data can be set in the portal depending on what language you are currently in.

dcterms.subject is the Portal Keywords
dcterms.modified is the Portal Last Modified On Date
dcterms.issued is the Portal Created on Date
dcterms.title is the current page Title (french version set through the PWGSC admin bar)
description is the Portal Description
dcterms.creater is the Portal Copyright

Extra Notes
______________________________________________

- Does not work well for editing the site in IE8, the JS slows it down

- Does not currently match the WPSS language settings

- Create a DNN config file with WET classes in it
